**Visita** is an all-in-one information system crafted to solve the real-world challenges of travel agencies. It replaces scattered spreadsheets and disjointed apps with a single, beautiful, and intuitive platform that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

## Why Visita? Core Pillars of Your New Workflow

Visita is built on principles designed to make your agency more efficient, transparent, and profitable.

### üèõÔ∏è Centralized Agency Management
Gain a bird's-eye view of your entire business from a powerful and secure admin dashboard.

*   **Full Employee Lifecycle Management:** Onboard new agents, manage roles, reset passwords, and deactivate accounts with ease.
*   **Dynamic Package & Service Crafting:** Build irresistible travel packages with rich descriptions, stunning image galleries, and pricing.
*   **Package Date Slots & Capacity Control:** A standout feature! Define specific travel dates for packages, set seat/slot capacity, and let Visita automatically track booked seats to prevent overbooking.
*   **Company-Wide Announcements:** Keep your entire team informed and aligned with a built-in announcement system, including the ability to pin critical updates to the dashboard.
*   **Comprehensive Data Archiving:** Safely archive old clients, packages, or reservations to keep your active workspace clean, with the ability to restore them at any time.

###  empowering Your Team
Give your agents the tools they need to succeed, with a personalized and mobile-friendly workspace.

*   **Personalized Agent Dashboards:** Each agent gets their own dashboard highlighting their client count, total bookings, and commission status.
*   **Dedicated Client & Reservation Lists:** Agents can manage their own portfolio of clients and track the status of every reservation they own.
*   **On-the-Go Access:** Agents can add clients, create bookings, and check details from their phone or tablet while in the field.
*   **Transparent Payout History:** Agents can view a complete history of all commission payouts they've received.

### üí∞ Financial Clarity & Control
From booking to payout, Visita provides a clear and accurate financial picture.

*   **Automated Commission Calculation:** Set flexible commission rules‚Äîeither general or package-specific‚Äîand let Visita calculate potential earnings for each booking automatically.
*   **Per-Reservation Payment Tracking:** Log multiple payments against any reservation and instantly see the total amount paid.
*   **Remaining Balance Visibility:** A dedicated screen shows all reservations with outstanding balances, making it easy to follow up on payments.
*   **Secure Payout Workflow:** Admins can review definite, unpaid commissions for each employee, select items for payment, and record the payout in a few clicks.

### ‚ú® A Beautiful Experience, On Any Device
Software should be a pleasure to use. Visita's interface is clean, modern, and fully responsive.

*   **Intelligent Responsive Design:** The layout fluidly transitions from a powerful, multi-paned view on a desktop monitor to a sleek, touch-friendly interface with a bottom navigation bar on mobile.
*   **Interactive Calendar View:** Visualize your agency's entire schedule. See all upcoming bookings in a rich calendar view, filterable and clickable for more details.
*   **Global-Ready:** Built from the ground up to support multiple languages, ensuring your entire team feels at home.
*   **Stunning Visuals:** From the elegant video background on the login screen to the polished UI components, every detail is designed to be professional and engaging.
